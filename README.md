# Problem Statement:

Small businesses, such as local restaurants and minimart, face a common challenge of generating valuable insights from their data due to limited resources for hiring analysts. To address this issue, there is a need to develop an affordable and user-friendly AI-driven Business Intelligence platform. This platform should enable small businesses to create data pipelines, generate interactive graphs, provide explanations, and offer chat functionality for optimizing business operations and decision-making.

## Primary Objectives:**

1. Build an AI data-driven analyst for small businesses.

## Secondary Objectives**

1. Data source.
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Building a Data pipeline for business niche.
4. Feeding the data into a GPT model (data analysis).
5. Feeding the output to the open source chatbot.
6. Chatbot give detailed explanation to the user.

## Context:
Small businesses often collect data from various sources but lack the expertise and resources to analyze and interpret this data effectively. This leads to missed opportunities for operational improvements, cost savings, and revenue growth. The proposed AI-driven Business Intelligence platform aims to bridge this gap by automating the data analysis process and providing actionable insights in a comprehensible manner.

## Scope:
The solution involves creating an AI-powered platform tailored to the needs of small businesses, for example, those in the restaurant industry. The platform will automate the process of data analysis, insights generation, and data pipeline creation. Additionally, it will offer interactive features like chat systems to enhance functionality and user engagement.

## Proposed Solution (functionality):
The AI-driven Business Intelligence platform will encompass the following features:

1. Pipeline Creation for data cleaning:
    - Enable seamless integration with various data sources, such as POS systems, inventory databases, and customer feedback.
    - Automatically create data pipelines tailored to the business needs, ensuring data is cleaned, transformed, and organized.
2. Automated Analysis and Insights Generation:
    - Utilize AI algorithms to analyze data and identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
    - Generate interactive graphs and visualizations to represent key performance indicators and insights.
3. Explanations and Context:
    - Provide plain language explanations for the generated insights, making complex data understandable for non-technical users.
    - Offer context to help business owners understand the implications of the insights on their operations.
4. Custom Dashboards:
    - Develop user-friendly and customizable dashboards that allow business owners to track specific KPIs and visualize data effectively.
5. Interactive Chat Functionality:
    - Implement a chatbot system that enables users to ask questions, seek clarification on insights, and receive real-time responses.
    - Optimize functionality through natural language processing and contextual understanding.
